*** NickServ Help - Command: GHOST ***
Terminates a "ghost" IRC session using your nick.
A "ghost" session is one which is not actually
connected, but which the IRC server believes is
still online for one reason or another. Typically,
this happens if your computer crashes or your Internet
or modem connection goes down while you're on IRC.
 
Please note that if someone else is using your nick
and you want to get it back, this is NOT the right
command. Please use RECOVER instead.
 
If your nick is held by services through an enforcer,
again this is NOT the right command. Please use
RELEASE instead.
 
Syntax:
 
/ns GHOST nickname password
 
Example:
/ns GHOST gogeta14 andrea
 
Type /join #IRCHelp for more information.
