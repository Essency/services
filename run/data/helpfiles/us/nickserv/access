This is the list of addresses which will be automatically
recognized by NickServ as allowed to use the nick. If you
want to use the nick from a different address, you need to
send an IDENTIFY command to make NickServ recognize you.
 
Note: The Access List will be ignored if you have
the SECURE option enabled.
