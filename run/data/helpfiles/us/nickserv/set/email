*** NickServ Help - Command: SET EMAIL ***
Lets you modify the E-Mail address associated to your
nickname. By specifying a new E-Mail address, an E-Mail
containing an authorization code will be sent to the
old address. You will need to supply this code to authorize
the change. If the old address is no longer valid, your
address will be changed after a period of 7 days, during
which you can cancel the request and keep the old address
with the UNDO option.
 
Note: The validity of the new E-Mail address will not
be checked. It is in your best interests to see that it
is real and working; we will NOT be able to send you
your nickname password, should you forget it, if the E-Mail
address is fake.
 
Syntax:
 
/ns SET EMAIL new@email.eu
/ns SET EMAIL <HIDE|SHOW|UNDO>
/ns SET EMAIL AUTH <code>
 
HIDE hides your E-Mail address to everyone except
yourself (default).
 
SHOW sets your address as public. Anyone doing
an INFO on your nick will see it.
 
AUTH authorizes a mail change request.
 
UNDO cancels an ongoing mail change request.
 
Examples:
/ns SET EMAIL pippo@carota.eu
/ns SET EMAIL AUTH 1034993210
