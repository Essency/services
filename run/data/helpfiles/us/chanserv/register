*** ChanServ Help - Command: REGISTER ***
Registers a channel in the ChanServ database. In order to use this command, you must
first be a channel operator on the channel you're trying to register. The password
is used with the IDENTIFY command to allow you to make changes to the channel
settings at a later time. The last parameter, which must be included, is a general
description of the channel's purpose.
 
When you register a channel, you are recorded as the "founder" of the channel.
The channel founder is allowed to change all of the channel settings for the channel;
ChanServ will also automatically give you channel-operator privileges when you
enter the channel, provided you identified to your nick before joining.
 
In order to register a channel, you must first registered your nickname.
If you haven't, type /ns HELP register for information on how to do so.
 
NOTICE: If you let the channel founder's nickname expire, and no Successor is set,
the channel will expire along with it and you will lose both.
 
WARNING: NEVER give your password to anyone else, even if you trust them.
Anyone knowing the channel password might be able to set himself as founder and
change it, and you would NOT be able to get the channel back.
