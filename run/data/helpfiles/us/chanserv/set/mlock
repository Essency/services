*** ChanServ Help - Command: SET MLOCK ***
Sets the mode-lock parameter for the channel. ChanServ allows you to define
certain channel modes to be always on (or off). The modes that can be locked
with this command are c, C, i, k, l, m, M, n, p, R,
s, t, u and U; each of these modes can be locked on, locked off, or not locked.
The <modes> parameter is constructed exactly the same way as a /MODE command;
modes followed by a + are locked on, and modes followed by a - are locked off.
When NONE is specified, mode-lock is disabled.

Note: If your current channel modelock is +nt and you want to add +s to it,
you will have to use +nst as modes, and NOT +s, which would lock +s only.
