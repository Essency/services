*** ChanServ Help - Command: AKICK ***
Maintains the AutoKick list for a channel. If a user on the AutoKick list
attempts to join the channel, ChanServ will ban that user from the channel,
then kick the user.
 
Syntax:
/cs AKICK #channel ADD <nick|mask> [bantype] [reason]
/cs AKICK #channel DEL <nick|mask|number>
/cs AKICK #channel LIST [pattern]
/cs AKICK #channel WIPE
/cs AKICK #channel LOCK [nick|mask]
/cs AKICK #channel UNLOCK [nick|mask]
 
The AKICK ADD command adds the given nick or usermask to the AutoKick list.
It is possible to specify the kind of ban applied to users who match a single
AKick entry. There are 10 available ban types, and they are the same as the
SET BANTYPE command. For a listing, type: /cs HELP SET BANTYPE
If a reason is given with the command, that reason will be used when the user
is kicked; if not, the default reason is "You have been banned from the channel."
 
The AKICK DEL command removes the given nick or mask from the AutoKick list.
It does not, however, remove any bans placed by an AutoKick; those must be
removed manually.
 
The AKICK LIST command displays the AutoKick list, or optionally only those
AutoKick entries matching the given mask.
 
The AKICK WIPE command removes all the nicks and masks from the AutoKick list.
 
The AKICK LOCK command locks the AutoKick list. Only the founder will be able
to manage it when it's locked. If a single entry is specified, only that one
will be locked.
 
The AKICK UNLOCK command unlocks the AutoKick list if it was previously
locked. If a single entry is specified, only that one will be unlocked.
