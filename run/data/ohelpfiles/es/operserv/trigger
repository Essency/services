*** OperServ Operator Help - Command: TRIGGER ***
Triggers are used to control clone warnings. The value specified
will be the number of clones from that user@host until services
warns the network. If the user@host already exists, the value is
re-triggered, and the network is notified.
 
Syntax: TRIGGER ADD user@host value [reason]
        TRIGGER DEL user@host
        TRIGGER LIST [start [end]] [pattern]
        TRIGGER CHECK user@host
 
ADD adds a trigger, or updates it if it's already present.
The reason can be omitted when updating an existing trigger's value.
Hosts have full CIDR support, and all triggers should be added
as CIDR or IP rather than host whenever possible.
 
DEL removes a trigger.
 
LIST shows the current trigger list. By default only the first
30 entries will be shown. If a pattern is specified, only the entries
matching it will be shown.
 
CHECK matches the given mask against all triggers and reports if
it is triggered or not.
 
Note: If automatic clone akill is enabled, triggered hosts
will never be auto-akilled.
 
This command is limited to Services Operators.
