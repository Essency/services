*** OperServ Operator Help - Command: BLACKLIST ***
Allows IRCops to manipulate the list of blacklisted E-Mail
addresses. If a user tries to register or change their nick's
E-Mail address to a blacklisted one, the attempt will be
logged, blocked, or both depending on the kind of blacklist
added.
 
Syntax: BLACKLIST ADD address type [reason]
        BLACKLIST DEL address
        BLACKLIST LIST [start [end]] [pattern]
 
ADD adds an E-Mail address to the list. type can be
one of NOTIFY (send a globop and allow registration/change),
DENY (block registration/change), or BLOCK (send a globop
and block registration/change).
 
This command is limited to Services Operators.
