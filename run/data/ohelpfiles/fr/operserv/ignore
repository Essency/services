*** OperServ Operator Help - Command: IGNORE ***
IGNORE is a useful tool to prevent abusive users from using services.
When an ignore mask is set, any user matching the mask will be ignored by services.
 
Syntax: IGNORE ADD|PERM mask reason
        IGNORE TIME expiry mask
        IGNORE DEL mask
        IGNORE LIST
 
ADD adds the given user@host mask to the IGNORE list for 60 minutes.
 
DEL removes the given mask from the IGNORE list if it is present.
 
LIST shows all current IGNOREs or only the ones matching the given mask, if any.
 
PERM adds the given user@host mask to the IGNORE list permanently.
 
TIME temporarily adds the given user@host mask to the IGNORE list.
expiry must be an integer followed by one of d (days), h (hours),
or m (minutes). If a unit specifier is not included, the default is
days (so +30 by itself means 30 days).
 
This command is limited to Services Operators.
